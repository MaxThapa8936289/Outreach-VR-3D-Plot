# Outreach-VR-3D-Plot

An 3D particle plotter for Unity to be experienced with the Oculus Rift. Based on Skrawk's GPU-GEMS-NBody-Simulation: https://github.com/Scrawk/GPU-GEMS-NBody-Simulation.

Two "fly-through-space" type programs are constructed to accept particle position and velocity data in .csv file format. This Project is "3D Plot", 2 of 2.

Files must be perfectly formatted with each line containing data in the form: x,y,z,vx,vy,vz,m

Files must be placed in /StreamingAssets/

3D Plot is a program to plat particle positions in 3D space. Particles are coloured based on local regional density. Files can be cycled during runtime. THERE MUST BE AT LEAST ONE FILE IN /StreamingAssets/.

See report for more information.
